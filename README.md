# Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Model for a QA Bot

This project implements a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** model for a Question Answering (QA) bot using **Pinecone DB** for efficient document embedding storage and retrieval, and **GPT-2** from Hugging Face Transformers for text generation.

## Project Overview

The QA bot allows users to input questions and retrieves relevant information from a provided document, then generates a coherent answer based on the retrieved content.

### Key Features

- **Document Embedding**: Uses a pre-trained model (`sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2`) to generate embeddings from document text.
- **Efficient Retrieval**: Stores embeddings in a **Pinecone** index for fast, scalable retrieval of the most relevant content.
- **Text Generation**: Utilizes GPT-2 to generate a coherent answer based on the retrieved document text and the user's query.
- **Handling Large Documents**: Truncates document text to fit within the model's token limits.

## Project Structure

- `load_document(pdf_path)`: This function reads a PDF file, extracts the text, generates document embeddings, and stores them in Pinecone for retrieval.
- `retrieve_relevant_info(question)`: Queries the Pinecone index with the user's question to retrieve relevant document segments.
- `generate_answer(question, document_text)`: Generates a response using GPT-2 based on the retrieved document content and the userâ€™s question.

## Installation

To run the project locally, install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install pinecone-client cohere transformers PyPDF2 torch
```

## Usage

1. **Initialize Pinecone**:
   Set up your Pinecone API key and environment:

   ```python
   pinecone.init(api_key="YOUR_PINECONE_API_KEY")
   ```

2. **Load a Document**:
   Load and process a PDF document by passing its path:

   ```python
   document_text = load_document("path/to/document.pdf")
   ```

3. **Query the QA Bot**:
   Ask a question related to the document:

   ```python
   doc_id, score = retrieve_relevant_info("What is the main focus of the document?")
   if doc_id:
       answer = generate_answer("What is the main focus of the document?", document_text)
       print(f"Answer: {answer}")
   ```

## Important Notes

- Ensure the document text is truncated to meet the token limits of the model.
- API keys for **Pinecone** and **Cohere** should be securely stored and used in your environment.
- You can adjust the number of tokens generated in the response by changing the `max_new_tokens` parameter in the text generation function.
